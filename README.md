# Anmut Data Science Hackathon Instructions

Thank you for participating in Anmut Consulting's data science hackathon. 

Anmut is a world-leading data valuation start up. Our goal is to help organisations realise the potential of their data so they can create better outcomes. We believe that a mix of data science and strategy consulting can help organisations better manage their data assets. If you have any questions about what we do, our team will be around on the day to answer any questions.

Now to the data science! The challenge for this hackathon is the following:

*"Who is the most powerful person in the world"*

There are many ways to approach this question and we are excited to see the approaches you come up with. To this end, we are far more interested in seeing evidence of creative problem solving than perfect code. So we recommend that you focus on this in your presentation.

Keep in mind that power can be defined in different ways. We might think about in terms of political influence, financial power, or even fame and media presence. You might also want to consider a more specific version of this question like who the most powerful woman is, or the most powerful self-made person.

We will explore the problem in more detail when we introduce it on the day.

Objectives:
* Define a methodology for calculating 'power'
* Determine who the most powerful person is, according to your metric
* Present your findings

You have five minutes to present your work. Your presentation should include your conceptual design, methodology and results. You are also welcome to explain how you would extend your analysis with more time.

This repository contains metadata that outlines the resources we will provide on the day. You may also use any data you source yourself.

Good luck,
The Anmut Team
